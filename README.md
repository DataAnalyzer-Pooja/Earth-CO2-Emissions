# Earth-CO2-Emissions
This project aims to thoroughly understand the worldwide carbon dioxide emissions landscape, the complexities of emissions and their significance in shaping our planet's future.

Welcome to the carbon dioxide emission data analysis case study as a part of the Portfolio Project of DataAnalyzer-Pooja.

# Problem Statement
Global warming is one of the biggest challenges currently being faced by humanity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address this issue by understanding the trends and patterns of carbon dioxide emissions globally. The problem at hand for this CO2 Emission project is to comprehensively investigate and analyze the increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which have emerged as a major contributor to global warming and climate change. Through this project, we will uncover valuable insights to understand their impact on the environment.

# About Dataset
The dataset used in this project has been downloaded from 'Our World in Data'. The dataset contains time-series data ranging from 1921 to 2020, having information on carbon dioxide emissions across various countries, regions, fuels and industries globally. This dataset helps us to understand how carbon dioxide emissions have evolved over the years and which areas and industries contribute the most. By analyzing this data, we can gain valuable insights to tackle the problem of carbon dioxide emissions and work towards reducing its impact on the environment.

# Business Task
Use this dataset for data cleaning, exploration and visualization to uncover the emission insights. Following questions needed to be answered by this analysis.
1. How have countries or regions carbon dioxide emission profiles changed over the years?
2. Have any countries or regions experienced significant changes in their emission per capita ratio over time?
3. What are the main drivers of carbon dioxide emissions in the dataset? Is it primarily attributed to specific industries or fuel types?
4. Have there been any notable shifts in the usage of different fuels for energy production and how have these changes impacted carbon dioxide emissions?
5. Has there been any shift in the energy consumption per GDP (Gross Domestic Product) ratio over time? How does this relate to changes in carbon dioxide emissions?
6. Is there any correlation between a country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and its carbon dioxide emissions? How has this relationship evolved over the years?
   
# Deliverables
